## Following the Flutter Course on Udemy

This app was developed following the second lection of the ["Flutter & Dart - The Complete Guide [2021 Edition]"](https://www.udemy.com/course/learn-flutter-dart-to-build-ios-android-apps/)

Al the code is commented with the theory explained by the teacher.

## What I've learned
- When to use StatefulWidger or StatelessWidget
- using public or private functions
- Manage user inputs: textFields, textEditingController, DatePicker.
- Format Datetime: DateFormat.yMd().format(_date)
- iterate lists to build widgets
- Connect widgets and share the State
- Listview and Listview.builder()
- Using the Future() class and the .then() method.
- Build adaptatives UI thanks to MediaQuery
- LayoutBuilder() to pass constraints so we can know the size of a widget
- Build diferent widgets depending on a condition. (condition) ? do this : else do that.
- Using different mothods of the List() class: .map(), .where(), .reversed().
- Importing and using images and different fonts
- Using FittedBox() to prevent a widget to grow if the content grows.
